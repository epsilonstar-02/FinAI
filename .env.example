# --- GENERAL SETTINGS ---
LOG_LEVEL=INFO # Common log level for all agents (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)

# --- ORCHESTRATOR & AGENT URLS ---
# These are typically used when running services separately (e.g., locally or different containers not on same Docker network).
# If using Docker Compose with a shared network, agents can often reach each other by service name (e.g., http://api_agent:8001).
# The defaults in each agent's config.py usually handle the Docker service name case.
# These are for overriding or for Streamlit app to know where Orchestrator is.
