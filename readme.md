## Use Case: Morning Market Briefing

Imagine starting your trading day with a simple voice command:

> "What's our risk exposure in Asia tech stocks today, and highlight any earnings surprises?"

FinAI responds with a concise, informative briefing:

> "Today, your Asia tech allocation is 22% of AUM, up from 18% yesterday. TSMC beat estimates by 4%, Samsung missed by 2%. Regional sentiment is neutral with a cautionary tilt due to rising yields."
